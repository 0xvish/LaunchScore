# 🚀 LaunchScore – Startup Success Predictor

**LaunchScore** is a hybrid AI-powered platform that predicts the likelihood of success for a startup idea using both:

- A **machine learning model** trained on Indian startup funding data.
- A **language model (LLM)** using LangChain with Gemini Pro and FAISS vector search for contextual analysis.

Users can enter their startup idea, sector, funding stage, location, funding amount, and founded year to get an overall success prediction along with insightful feedback.

---

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Neural Network-based ML model trained on real-world startup funding data.
- ✅ LLM-powered qualitative analysis using Gemini Pro and LangChain.
- ✅ FAISS-powered retrieval from a startup dataset for enhanced context.
- ✅ Fully responsive frontend (TailwindCSS).
- ✅ Flask API backend.
- ✅ One-click deployment ready.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. 📦 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/launchscore.git
cd launchscore
```

### 2. 🐍 Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. 📄 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. 🔐 Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google API Key:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
```

You can obtain one for free from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app).

### 5. ▶️ Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## 🧪 Testing the App

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

Fill in the following:

- ✍️ **Startup Idea** – A clear description of your startup
- 🏷️ **Sector** – e.g., EdTech, FinTech, HealthTech
- 💰 **Funding Stage** – e.g., Seed, Series A, Pre-Series B
- 📍 **Headquarter** – e.g., Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi
- 📅 **Founded Year** – e.g., 2023
- 💵 **Funding Amount (in ₹Rupees)** – e.g., 1000000

Click **Predict** to view:

- The ML & LLM scores
- A combined score out of 10
- Insights and reasoning from the LLM

---

## 📊 How It Works

- **ML Score**: Computed from structured inputs using a neural network trained on a labeled dataset.
- **LLM Score**: Generated by LangChain + Gemini Pro using contextual data from similar startups retrieved by FAISS.
- **Final Score**: Average of the ML and LLM scores (scaled to 10).

---

## 📚 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask + LangChain + Gemini Pro (via Google GenerativeAI)
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS, HTML, JavaScript
- **ML**: Scikit-learn MLPClassifier with pipeline
- **Vector Search**: FAISS
- **Embeddings**: HuggingFace `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

---

## 📌 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
